//PERSON TASK:
//1)Create a Person class with a few variables (height, name, shoe size, job title, age).
//2) Generate a constructor with all of them.
//3) Create another constructor that only has name and height.
//4) Create 2 methods that use these variable (e.g. greet - similar to the one I showed you). They SHOULD NOT be static. 
//5) Create 4 instances of the Person class in your runner and call the methods.
